## 🚀 Production Readiness Checklist

- [x] Migrated to Next.js (SSR-ready, production-optimized)
- [x] Removed old React clients
- [x] Organized scripts into dedicated folder
- [x] Created .gitignore for sensitive files
- [x] Docker Compose configuration for both dev and production
- [x] Traefik as reverse proxy with ForwardAuth
- [ ] Update environment variables for production
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Set up production database backup strategy

   - Set secure JWT_SECRET
   - Configure production MongoDB URI

2. **Security:**
   - Enable HTTPS in Traefik
   - Add rate limiting
   - Configure CORS properly
   - Run `npm audit fix`

3. **Performance:**
   - Enable Next.js caching
   - Configure CDN for static assets
   - Optimize Docker images (multi-stage builds)

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Add application monitoring (PM2, New Relic, etc.)
   - Set up error tracking (Sentry)
   - Configure log aggregation
